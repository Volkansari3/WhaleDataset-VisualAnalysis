# WhaleDataset-VisualAnalysis 🐋🐬

This project presents a visual analysis of whale and dolphin sightings using a dataset provided by OBIS-SEAMAP.  
The analysis explores spatial and temporal patterns of marine mammals across different geographic regions and time periods, using a variety of visual techniques.

## 📊 Key Features

- 📍 **Geospatial Mapping**  
  Using `scatter_geo`, whale and dolphin sightings are plotted globally based on latitude and longitude.

- 🌡️ **Environmental Analysis**  
  The dataset includes **sea surface temperature**, **bathymetry (depth)**, and **latitude**, allowing comparisons across species and oceanic regions.

- 📦 **Species Grouping and Aggregation**  
  Observations are grouped by species, enabling average-depth, temperature, and spatial distribution analysis.

- 📈 **Temporal Trend Analysis**  
  Sightings over multiple decades are visualized to explore possible seasonal or long-term trends.

- 🎨 **Visual Methods Used**  
  - Heatmaps  
  - Boxplots  
  - Countplots  
  - Scatter plots  
  - Strip plots  
  - Interactive geographical maps (`plotly`)
